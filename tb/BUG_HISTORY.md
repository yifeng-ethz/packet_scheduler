# OPQ Bug History

## 2026-04-17 SWB 4-lane sparse-frame cadence drops later hits

- First seen:
  - `packet_scheduler/tb/uvm` `TEST=opq_prof_missing_empty_frame_test OPQ_N_LANE=4`
  - consistent with `packet_scheduler/tb_int/uvm` `tb_int_longrun_sanity_test +TB_INT_LONGRUN_CASE_ID=1`
- Symptom:
  - standalone 4-lane OPQ passes equal-cadence FEB whole-frame traffic but drops later hits when some lanes stop emitting frames instead of sending empty-frame cadence
  - reproducer result: `expected=6 actual=4 missing=2 ghost=0`
  - integrated clue: stage-D per-lane frame counts are highly uneven (`57/128/57/73`) and OPQ remains stuck near the first frame (`ft_wr_hdr=1 ft_wr_shd=0 ft_wr_hit=0 stage_e=0` in the earlier long-run snapshot)
- Root cause status:
  - open, but the evidence points to a contract mismatch around sparse per-lane frame cadence
  - OPQ already has an explicit ingress lane-mask CSR; verified in standalone 4-lane DV with `opq_error_lane_mask_test`
  - this bug therefore applies to the unmasked case (`lane_mask=0`), not to intentionally quiescent lanes that are masked off by configuration
  - the monolithic 4-lane page allocator advances only when every lane has a stable pending ticket or an end-of-frame condition, so lanes that simply stop producing frames can hold back later active-lane traffic
  - this is consistent with the standalone reproducer, where unequal lane frame counts without empty-frame padding lose real lane-1 hits
- Candidate fixes:
  - configure the existing OPQ lane-mask CSR whenever a lane is intentionally quiescent
  - add an SWB/FEB ingress normalizer that synthesizes empty frames for idle lanes when masking is not available or not desirable
  - or upgrade OPQ fetch/allocation so quiescent lanes do not block later active-lane frames
- Fix status:
  - open
- Fix commit:
  - pending


## 2026-04-17 Native SV empty-frame drain replays trailer-only packets

- First seen:
  - `packet_scheduler/tb/uvm` `TEST=opq_basic_feb_packet_contract_test OPQ_N_LANE=2 DUT_IMPL=native_sv`
  - VHDL reference under the same FEB-contract sequence emitted full empty frames; native SV emitted trailer-only packets at later frame boundaries and tripped `opq_hit3_contract_sva`
- Symptom:
  - frame 0 hit integrity was clean after the presenter tail fix, but the next frames collapsed to lone trailers
  - native egress around the second frame was `... trailer, trailer, trailer ...` instead of `header, 8 empty subheaders, trailer`
- Root cause:
  - `ordered_priority_queue_monolithic_page_allocator.sv` declared and updated `eop_flush_ack`, but never drove `eop_flush_ack_o`
  - the ingress parser therefore never cleared `alert_eop`, and the page allocator kept re-entering `tail_only_flush`
- Fix status:
  - fixed
- Fix commit:
  - `37c4b2a` `Fix native OPQ FEB reference path`

## 2026-04-17 Native SV 4-lane FEB path corrupts middle-lane hit placement

- First seen:
  - `packet_scheduler/tb/uvm` `TEST=opq_basic_feb_packet_contract_test OPQ_N_LANE=4 DUT_IMPL=native_sv`
  - VHDL reference under the same FEB-contract sequence produced `missing=0 ghost=0`
- Symptom:
  - native 4-lane egress emitted lane0 hits, then lane3 hits, then four zero ghosts; lane1 and lane2 hits were missing
  - before the datapath bug was visible, the native 4-lane UVM harness also hard-failed because `tb_top` still blocked `OPQ_USE_NATIVE_SV` at 4 lanes and instantiated the VHDL-only `ordered_priority_queue_dut4`
- Root cause:
  - `ordered_priority_queue_monolithic_page_allocator.sv` computed `page_allocator_if_alloc_blk_start[i]` from only `ticket[i-1].block_length`, which is sufficient for 2 lanes but wrong for 4 lanes; the VHDL reference uses a cumulative prefix offset across accepted prior lanes
  - the native SV wrapper/harness was still 2-lane hard-coded, so the 4-lane FEB-contract testcase could not reach the datapath until the wrapper and `tb_top` were extended
- Fix status:
  - fixed
- Fix commit:
  - `37c4b2a` `Fix native OPQ FEB reference path`

## 2026-04-17 Native SV CSR plane returned zeros and hid live credits

- First seen:
  - `packet_scheduler/tb/uvm` `TEST=opq_basic_feb_packet_contract_test OPQ_N_LANE=2 DUT_IMPL=native_sv`
- Symptom:
  - native SV datapath matched the VHDL FEB reference, but the CSR wrapper hard-returned zero data, could not program DRR allowance before traffic, and misreported restored lane/ticket credits at the end of the run
  - the first native bring-up also tripped the CSR SVA because `readdatavalid` did not match the expected Avalon/MM read contract
- Root cause:
  - `ordered_priority_queue_dut_sv.sv` still contained a stub CSR plane instead of the VHDL-visible register map
  - there was no native plumbing for programmable DRR allowance into the block path, no live counter/counter-accumulation logic, and the wrapper exposed raw internal credit state rather than the visible restored credit contract used by the VHDL DUT
- Fix status:
  - fixed
- Fix commit:
  - `6b9ed41` `Fix native SV OPQ CSR plane and CSR proof traffic`

## 2026-04-17 Cross-bucket CSR proof used non-FEB ingress framing

- First seen:
  - `packet_scheduler/tb/uvm` `TEST=opq_cross_bp_credit_test OPQ_N_LANE=2 DUT_IMPL=native_sv`
  - `packet_scheduler/tb/uvm` `TEST=opq_cross_drr_allowance_test OPQ_N_LANE=2 DUT_IMPL=native_sv`
- Symptom:
  - both tests completed with clean UVM scoreboard accounting, but the ingress SVA fired on every frame because the stress sequences asserted fresh `sop` on subheaders instead of using one whole-frame packet with trailer-only `eop`
- Root cause:
  - `opq_soak_virtual_sequence` and `opq_drr_saturation_virtual_sequence` were still driving split-packet synthetic traffic, while the active signoff contract for OPQ debug is FEB whole-frame traffic
- Fix status:
  - fixed
- Fix commit:
  - `6b9ed41` `Fix native SV OPQ CSR plane and CSR proof traffic`
